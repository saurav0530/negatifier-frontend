    * ``` REACT_APP_BACK_URL_PROJ1 = 'http://localhost:4000'```
    * ``` REACT_APP_BACK_URL_PROJ2 = 'http://localhost:5000'```
* Run the following commands:
    * ```npm install ``` OR &nbsp; ```  yarn install``` 
    * ```npm start ``` OR &nbsp; ```  yarn start``` 
* Frontend will be up at PORT 3000. The same will automatically be opened in your browser.
